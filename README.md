More Swifty approach to parsing JSON

Although it turned out after I wrote it that [swiftz](https://github.com/typelift/swiftz/blob/master/swiftz/JSON.swift) is based on the exact same basic idea, I'm releasing the code anyway.

## TODO
- Provide a way to parse specific objects, perhaps by way of validating the object agains a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org).
